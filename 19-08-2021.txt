Collections:- 


Arrays:- 
Collection of Data same data. int ---it will take integer.... static if i mention 10 variable it will take only 10 variables.
int [] list=new int[10];

static--limited
dynamic---- unlimited


Collections came into picture... Collection is also an interface which has multiple method declarations

Collection interface has multiple implemented classes

interface A{
void getA();


}
class B implements A{

}
