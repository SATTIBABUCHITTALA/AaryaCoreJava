Java 
OOPS ---Object oriented Programming Language

JVM
JRE
JDK

-----OOPs Concepts
1. Class
2. Object
3. methods
4. Operators
5. Condtional Statements
6. for loop
7. While loop
8. Naming Conventions in java
8. Constructor
Types of Constructors:-
2 Types
1. Default Constructor
2. Parameterized Constructor
Inheritance:- 
Types of Inheritance:-
1. Single Inheritance
2. Multi Level Inheritance
3. Hierarchial Inheritance
4. Multiple Inheritance.
Encapsulation:- getters and Setters
Access Modifiers:- public, protected, private, default
Data Types:- int,char, String, long,double

We didnot discuss the Multiple Inheritance:- 
class is accessing properties of more than one class:

class A extends B,C{

}
but java doesnot support the multiple inheritance:-
Reason is Why?
can we have same method in two classes?

yes or no? There will be an ambiguity.
class  A{

void getDetails(){
}

}
class B{
void getDetails(){
}
}

class C extends A,B{

}
C c=new C();
c.getDetails();
Multiple Inheritanc Does not support by java. 
Got my point?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Arrays

Array is nothing but a datatype holding Collection of similar Data.

int a;
10,
12,
13
collection of Data:- 

int [10] num;

Multiple Types of Arrays will be there in Java
1. one Dimensional Array
2. Two Dimensional Array

int[X][Y] list=new int();
X- Rows
Y- Columns
---It contains Homogenious Data.
Different Data it will not allow.
It is Static .....
int[10] list;
static nature. 

Collections Concepts:-

this key word:- It indicates current object



class A{

int var;


void getVar(int var){

this.var=var;

}




}
